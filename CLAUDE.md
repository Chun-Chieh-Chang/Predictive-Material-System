# CLAUDE.md — Karpathy Coding Guidelines & Project Rules

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes, derived from [Andrej Karpathy's observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) on LLM coding pitfalls.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding
**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**
- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask rather than guess.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

---

## 2. Simplicity First
**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**
- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Ask yourself: *"Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"* If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes
**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.
- When your changes create orphans: remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Ask yourself: *"Can every changed line trace directly to the user's request?"*

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution
**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**
- Transform imperative tasks into declarative goals with verification loops:
  `1. [Step] -> verify: [check command]`
  `2. [Step] -> verify: [check command]`
  `3. [Step] -> verify: [check command]`
- Strong success criteria enable rigorous independent validation.
